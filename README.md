# University of Leciester Hackathon

Welcome to the Hacakthon!  This is a chance to build your own app in an agile team.  You will have 2 days to work on your ideas and bring it to life using the skills you've aquired throughout your degree (and from googling!).

## The Hackathon - February 2024
Throughout the hackathon you will have IBM Hackathon Coaches to help you with every stage of your project from idea creation though development, testing and preparing your demo for submission. Your coaches are listed on the slides alongside their area of expertise so go ahead and approach whichever coach will be of most use and utilise thier skills.

### Timetable

## The Prize  
The grand prize will be a tailored IBM Insight Day for each squad member of the winning team. Insight days consist of an office visit with the oppurtunity to shadow someone in the relevant field, mock interviews, networking oppurtunities, Q&As etc. All great things you can add to your experinces and CV.

## The Project  
**Improve University Life**  

Uni life is great... but what could make it even better? Think innovation! What do we need? What doesnt yet exist? Or what does exist but can be greatly improved?
 
- Perhaps a healthy/simple cooking site to help students eat better with their student budgets?
- Maybe an app to keep track of society finances – fees, social budgets, ticket sales etc?
- or an app to help review Uni events and have a 1 stop shop for all events across the uni/societies with easy booking, information access etc?

## About the app
* In your teams, plan you app and ideas using Mural, Jamboard, post-its or paper.
* You can build the app using whatever skills you have - theres no limitations!
* It's always best to host the app somewhere and provide the judges with a URL. The best options are AWS or Firebase but use any you are comfortable with. 
* If you are creating an IoT device, you could use [Watson IoT platform](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-iot-platform).

## The demo attendees

## The Demo Showcase

You will have 15 minutes to showcase your fantastic work to the judges. Here are some useful tips:
* Tell us your app story
* Why does your app stand out from the others we could use instead??
* How did you do your user research?
* How would it be funded? By who?
* What cool functionality/tech is there behind the scenes that we cant see from the UI?
* Did you enjoy making it? tell us why!
* Show your wireframes so we can see the bits you didn’t have time to build. What would you build if you had more time?
* Give us your urls! Though we are curious people so don’t give it to us until you want us to start playing and stop listening...

## Resources

**Design tools**:

- It might be useful once you have settled on your idea to create some wireframes so you know what the UI will look like before starting development.
- [What are wireframes?](https://www.experienceux.co.uk/faqs/what-is-wireframing/)
- [Pop](https://marvelapp.com/pop) is a fun app for paper prototyping (creating wireframes for the UI)

**Design Thinking**

You may hear the term Design Thinking in your projects at IBM. Design Thinking is, "an iterative process in which we seek to understand the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine problems in an attempt to identify alternative strategies and solutions that might not be instantly apparent with our initial level of understanding". Try and use it whilst designing your apps.

## Previous Hackathons

### The Covid Hackathon App
We have previously created a sample React app that was used for a Hackathon with a Covid theme.  You can take a look at the app for ideas and sample code which will show you how to talk to an API using React.

- View the code of [the Covid Information react App](https://github.ibm.com/CIC-UK/covid-hackathon-2020)
- You can also see the app online: [covid-hackathon-2020.eu-gb.mybluemix.net](https://covid-hackathon-2020.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/)

### The Anti Social-distancing Hackathon App
Teams were tasked to create apps to bring people closer together as restrictions started to ease.
- [DinnerParty](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEbfmHlfUA/v6Ks-JnRipm-TU-RMFLgFg/view?utm_content=DAEbfmHlfUA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer): an app that lets you cook together
- IBeerM: an app to help you choose what pub to meet at and create pub crawls
- Catch Me Outside: an app to arrange meetups and activities

### Recycling
Looking after the environment is becoming increasingly important to many people. The CIC Green Team are working towards making the CIC more environmentally friendly and sustainable through various initiatives. As its not always clear what can or cannot be recycled the Developer Practice teamed up with the CIC Green Team to run a ‘Recycling’ hackathon! Based on the idea of a Recycling Assistant we challenged the associates to get creative and build some apps to help us recycle in our daily lives.

Here’s a glimpse of what was created:

-	PalCycle: A mobile app that can scan the barcodes on packaging and tell the user what part of it can be recycled
-	Breez-e: An app that uses AI to help identify products and tell you how you can recycle it – the more you recycle the more points you earn for rewards!
-	TreeCycle: An app that allows the CIC centres to track how much they recycle and compete against each other to grow their own forest – Recycle and watch your forest bloom, don’t recycle and you’ll see your tree wither and pollution will take over…
-	Crafts4Kids: An app full of arts and craft guides to help you re-use your recyclable rubbish into fun new items for your home


### Energy Efficiency
There are a number of reasons why you should consider cutting back on energy consumption. Reducing energy use limits the number of carbon emissions in the environment and produces a higher quality of life for everyone. Carbon emissions play a significant role in climate change, which is thought to be the cause of powerful natural disasters in recent years. With billions of harmful emissions in the atmosphere, cutting back is always a good thing. Reduced emissions result in cleaner air quality creating a healthier planet, or at least helps sustain the resources we already have. Being conservative with energy can ensure that lakes, trees and animals are around for future generations.

The Apps created:

- Team GOAT – Kettle Pool – an app that makes coffee breaks easier and energy efficient, as well as having a social aspect. The team discovered that people tend to overfill a kettle but 2 cups. Given the average kettle contains about a pint and half, the research suggests the country is collectively wasting three quarters of a billion pounds a year, about £25 per household. This prompted the team to design a kettle pooling app where users can sign up to a pool and share water and electricity to make a hot drink. This would make a great app for an office to not only save the company money but also allow people to meet, connect and join in with ‘water cooler’ conversations.

- Team ? – nrg. – a habit tracker app that could link with the smart devices around your home and turn them off when you go out to help save money and emissions. The app records what appliances you own and provides reminders for you to turn off devices, lower your heating and switch devices into eco-friendly modes. The app aims to changes people’s habits and get them into a routine that will save on energy usage, emissions and bills. The app also provides analytics and visualisations to show where you can be saving money and how much you could save by altering your habits.

- Team GR – Shift Energy – an app that enables users to enter their current car Co2 information and budget to get energy efficient recommendations in chart format. All team members had a common interest in cars, and so decided to link energy efficiency with cars by basing their app on carbon emissions.

- Team SME – Bulbry – an app that allows you to input your light bulbs and see analytics on your usage and how much energy you could be saving by switching to more energy efficient bulbs. Users are provided with interesting facts, collected from Which?, about the environmental impact of their bulb choice and told how much money could save.


### The Humanitarian Crisis Hackathon

Wars and climate change are already forcing millions of people to flee and leave their homes everyday, and by 2050, the World Bank estimates that 143 million people will be displaced by climate change alone. 

Facing the new reality that forced migration is not a temporary crisis, we must now work at enhancing resilience and preparedness within our communities, and improve our ability to welcome and support people that are forcibly displaced. We no longer have the time to be FOR or AGAINST migration.

ould we build a way for them to locate and reunite with each other? A way to record and report the time and location of crime against refugees? A way for them, and any they choose to represent them, to be heard so that their actual needs are met, and not those we suppose they have?

Our Associate cohort teams tackled this challenge by creating:

- RefuSential: an app to request services such as food and housing and claim donations from companies and the general public. The app incorporated a chatbot to help provide services and help to refugees quicker and aimed to show a map to focus crisis aid and relief. 

- Manna Care: an online marketplace for people to donate to refugees

- Voice of a Refugee: a powerful social media platform where refugees can share their personal stories and hardships and connect to donors who can provide aid and support. The app forms a relationship between the donor and recipient so they can stay in contact, make continued donations and see how thier aid is improving the lives of those they donate to.

- RefugeeFund: an app to help refugees make payments in a foreign country. People can donate to the all and refugees can claim donations to help them with public transport or shopping for essentials. Donations would be converted into barcodes/QR codes so refugees can easily pay for things without needing to handle money or set up bank accounts. The UI was entirely icons to prevent language barriers.

- Charitable: a donation site to allow companies and individuals to sponsor refugees and give aid. The App also had current world news so you could keep up with the crisis situation.


### The IoT Pollinator Garden

The Leicester Pollinator garden is an initiative led by the CIC Green Team to build and manage a pollinator garden outside the Leicester office. The plans involve 10 flower beds for wildflowers, spring bulbs etc in a grassed area and 4 hot bins for composting leaves and/or kitchen scraps (to feed all these hungry plants). The garden is important because pollinators have suffered greatly from loss of habitat, misuse of chemicals and spread of invasive plant and animal species. Many pollinators have disappeared, and others are endangered.

The garden is a challenge to maintain and COVID along with the work from home revolution means there are less people in the office, there is no outside tap and plant varieties can be difficult to look after! We challenged the associates to use the IoT sensors the Innovation Team will set up to create an app to help us maintain our garden and keep it alive!
Our Associate cohort teams came up with some great ideas: 


- Ecoders created I Bee Monitor, which is an application that uses cloud based image processing to calculate how many Bees are in photos sent from an IoT camera and keeps a track of pollinators in the garden! It also has a quiz to improve your knowledge of pollinators and promoted social media engagement by allowing you to share your quiz scores and photos from the pollinator garden!

- 50% As, 50% Bs created Bloom, a wellness app that aims to get you outside into the pollinator garden to promote wellbeing through garden care gamification. You need a minimum of 120minutes per week to see effects (White et al., 2019), and Bloom can help you achieve it!

- Fast And Curious created PlantCare, a slack integrated web application that used the IoT sensors in the garden to send notifications to people subscribed to the channel stating what actions are needed in the garden. The UI also had an easy to use traffic light system to identify which flower beds needed action.

- Hackathon Squad created Pollin8, a slack integrated web application built on a logic engine using IoT sensor data to create a task list to allow gardeners to complete the highest priority actions when they are in the office.

- TheBeezBuzz created a self-titled app which integrated with the IoT sensors and weather API’s to give real time updates and tasks for garden welfare.


**Leicester Car Park Conundrum**  

The Leicester Office has limited parking which is currently first come first serve, and if you are too late you are stuck with a car and no idea where to park it!

There are several car parks within walking distance to the office which are pay and display at various prices and which have varying reviews on whether or not you can safely leave your car there. 

We challenged the teams to devise a way to help thier colleagues park in Leicester!

The winning app is now a giveback project on its way to being used as the official office parking app.

**IBM Consulting Assistant GenAI for Operations and HR**  

IBM Consulting Sidekick AI is an enterprise-safe IBM Consulting tool that augments IBM Consultants daily work by pairing our multi-model Generative AI technical strategy with our deep experience across technology and industry.

The teams built chat bots based on LLMs and GenAI to help answer questions for Senior Leadership and HR concerns.
